# Recip-E
## Vision Statement

The Recip-E app will allow users to create and manage a digital cookbook on their personal device. Its main purpose is to replace all other recipe sources, such as index cards, cookbooks, and modern technologies, for chefs of every skill level and age range. 

Specifically, Recip-E users will be able to see a list of ingredients, necessary steps, and a picture, if available. The app will allow users to add recipes by writing their own or receiving a shared recipe from another user. Additionally, a few existing default recipes will be available when users begin. Correspondingly, users will be able to remove or edit recipes, including the default recipes, in similar fashion to how people make notes in or throw away old cookbooks. 

Undoubtedly, users will want to use this app because it provides easy access to all of their recipes in one convenient and centralized place. It will save them the trouble of aimlessly flipping through multiple cookbooks or other sources, making meal planning and entertaining easier. In addition, the app will be a handy quick reference for professional chefs or home cooks who want to double-check an ingredient or step. Recip-E is also the perfect go to for beginners who are starting from scratch and have no idea on where to begin with a recipe.

Furthermore, the portability of Recip-E allows users to record recipes wherever they are and whenever they like. For instance, at Grandma’s house, on a road trip with friends, or even just jotting down an idea for a new recipe as a person is getting ready for bed. 

Beyond the kitchen, Recip-E will help users downsize their paper cookbook collection by digitizing their recipes. This can also help preserve family recipes for future generations. To add to that, digitization allows for faster and easier sharing of recipes, instead of making a hard copy or taking a picture of a recipe. Recip-E is the perfect alternative for people who prefer digital over hard copies. I mean who wants to keep hundreds of physical copies in this modern age? Moreover, the app is even eco-friendly in that it allows people to go paper-free. 

Finally, Recip-E’s success will be measured by several criteria. Firstly, a targeted user survey will provide feedback on the overall usability of the app. We can use this feedback to enhance the user experience. Next, the overall number of users and any ratings volunteered by said users will indicate how widely adopted the app is. In addition, the average number of recipes per user will indicate the app’s general usage. For example, a high average will imply that users are generally using the app to digitize their recipe collections, as intended, while a low number will imply that perhaps users are only using the app to preserve and/or share a few core recipes. Finally, the average number of times users open the app daily will indicate how successful the app has been in replacing other recipe sources.
